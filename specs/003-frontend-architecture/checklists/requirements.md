# Specification Quality Checklist: Frontend Architecture

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All checklist items pass validation
- The specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- Key assumptions made:
  - Sidebar minimum/maximum widths (200px-500px) based on common UI patterns
  - Keyboard shortcuts (Cmd/Ctrl+B) follow standard application conventions
  - Connection status indicators follow standard color conventions (green=connected, yellow=connecting, red=error)
  - UI state persistence uses browser localStorage (standard for web/Tauri apps)
